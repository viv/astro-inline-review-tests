<Base title="Home — Fixture Site">
  <h1>Welcome to the Fixture Site</h1>

  <p id="intro-paragraph">
    This is the introduction paragraph of the fixture site. It contains enough
    text to be a realistic target for text selection and annotation testing. The
    content is deliberately predictable so that automated tests can reliably
    find and select specific phrases.
  </p>

  <h2>About This Page</h2>

  <p id="about-paragraph">
    The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This classic pangram is used
    here because it contains every letter of the alphabet and is instantly
    recognisable. Annotations created on this paragraph should persist across
    page reloads and be scoped to the home page URL.
  </p>

  <p id="technical-paragraph">
    Software engineering requires careful attention to detail. Every function
    should have a clear purpose, every module a well-defined boundary. Testing
    is not an afterthought but an integral part of the development process that
    guides design decisions and catches regressions early.
  </p>

  <h2>Inline Elements Section</h2>

  <p id="inline-elements-paragraph">
    This paragraph contains <strong>bold text</strong> and <em>italic text</em> and a
    <a href="#">hyperlink element</a> embedded within it for testing annotation of text
    that spans across inline formatting boundaries.
  </p>

  <h2>Cross-Element Section</h2>

  <p id="cross-element-start">
    This paragraph starts a thought that continues
  </p>
  <p id="cross-element-end">
    into this second paragraph, creating a cross-element selection opportunity.
  </p>

  <h2>Special Characters Section</h2>

  <p id="special-chars-paragraph">
    Here are some special characters: "quoted text" and <angle brackets> and
    ampersands & symbols. Unicode works too: café, naïve, résumé. These should
    all be handled gracefully by the annotation system without encoding issues.
  </p>

  <h2>Long Content Section</h2>

  <p id="long-paragraph">
    This is a deliberately long paragraph designed to test how the system handles
    extended text selections. When a user selects a very long passage of text,
    the annotation system needs to store the full selection but may truncate the
    preview in the UI for readability. The range serialisation must capture the
    exact start and end positions regardless of length. This paragraph continues
    with more content to ensure it exceeds the typical preview length. Additional
    sentences are included here to pad the content further. The total length of
    this paragraph should comfortably exceed five hundred characters when fully
    rendered in the browser. We keep adding more text to make absolutely sure
    that the long passage selection test has enough content to work with. This
    should now be well over the threshold needed for testing purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>Element Annotation Targets</h2>

  <section id="hero-section" class="hero-section" data-testid="hero">
    <img id="hero-image" class="hero-image" src="https://placehold.co/600x200" alt="Hero banner" />
    <button id="cta-button" class="btn-primary" type="button">Get Started</button>
  </section>

  <div class="card-container" data-testid="card-container">
    <div class="card" data-testid="feature-card">
      <h3>Feature Card</h3>
      <p>This card is a target for element annotation testing.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <nav id="test-nav" class="test-navigation" role="navigation" aria-label="Test navigation">
    <a href="/" class="nav-link">Home</a>
    <a href="/second" class="nav-link">Second Page</a>
  </nav>

  <section id="simple-section" class="simple-section">
    A simple section for element annotation testing.
  </section>

  <div class="bare-div">
    <span>A bare div with no id or data-testid — tests positional selector generation.</span>
  </div>

  <h2>Additional Content for Scrolling</h2>

  <p>
    This section exists purely to make the page long enough to require scrolling.
    Scroll-related tests need content below the fold to verify that the FAB
    maintains its fixed position and that scroll-to-highlight functionality works
    correctly when annotations are off-screen.
  </p>

  <p>
    More padding content follows. The page needs to be significantly taller than
    the viewport to test scroll behaviours. Each paragraph adds height and creates
    a realistic page structure that mirrors how real websites are laid out.
  </p>

  <p>
    Even more content here to ensure scrollability. Tests that verify the FAB
    stays fixed during scroll, or that clicking an annotation in the panel scrolls
    to the correct highlight, all depend on having enough vertical content to make
    the page scrollable.
  </p>

  <p>
    A fourth padding paragraph. Some tests check that annotations created on
    content that is currently off-screen can be navigated to via the review panel.
    This requires the target content to be reliably below the viewport fold.
  </p>

  <p>
    Final padding paragraph on the home page. This completes the scrollable area
    and gives tests a known endpoint. The fixture content is now complete with
    identifiable paragraphs, special characters, cross-element boundaries, and
    sufficient length for scroll-based interactions.
  </p>
</Base>
