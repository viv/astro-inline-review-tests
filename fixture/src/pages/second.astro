<Base title="Second Page — Fixture Site">
  <h1>Second Page</h1>

  <p id="second-intro">
    This is the second page of the fixture site. It exists to test multi-page
    annotation scoping. Annotations created here should not appear as highlights
    on the home page, and vice versa. The badge count on the FAB should reflect
    only annotations for the current page.
  </p>

  <h2>Distinct Content</h2>

  <p id="second-unique">
    The wallaby bounces across the red desert at dawn. This sentence is unique
    to the second page and does not appear anywhere on the home page. Tests can
    use this text to verify that annotations are correctly scoped by URL and
    that the All Pages tab in the review panel groups content appropriately.
  </p>

  <p id="second-technical">
    Multi-page annotation systems must track which page each annotation belongs
    to. The page URL serves as the scoping key. When navigating between pages,
    the client must update the visible highlights and badge count to reflect
    only the current page's annotations whilst maintaining the full dataset in
    storage for the All Pages view and markdown export.
  </p>

  <h2>More Content</h2>

  <p>
    Additional content on the second page to ensure it has enough substance for
    testing. Page notes added here should be scoped to the /second URL and should
    appear separately from home page notes in both the panel and the export.
  </p>

  <p>
    Further padding to make the second page scrollable as well. Some multi-page
    tests may need to verify scroll behaviour on secondary pages, so having
    enough content here is important for comprehensive coverage.
  </p>

  <p>
    The second page concludes with this paragraph. Tests verifying the export
    format should see this page listed under its own heading with its own set of
    annotations and page notes, separated from the home page by a horizontal
    rule in the markdown output.
  </p>
